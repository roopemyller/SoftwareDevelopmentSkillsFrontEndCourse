This is my Software Development Skills couse project

Here you can find my couse project

This website is inspired by the Lappeenrannan teekkarireservil√§iset website.
I have been updating the Lateres web page and I thought that I could do it from the ground up as a project for this course.

Lateres website uses hugo with the Syna theme. Lateres website repository can be found here:
https://github.com/lateres/Lateres-web-source and the url here: https://lateres.fi/

Mainly the text parts are all the same in both but the "Tapahtumat" and "Yhteystiedot" section in my 'mock' website are only in my version and can't be found from the official website(atleast not yet maybe in the future).

I have also left some things out of the original website.

The deployed website can be accessed here:
